Hey, remember me from before?
I've come to tell you that you have the right idea wanting to leave this place. 
Everyone around these parts also had your idea of escape but were not able to.
Being outside of your district for too long messes you up and they ended up manifesting their own realitys into this world.
To get to him you will have to transverse thought these realitys and to do that you need to truly exist within them. 
hopefully you have what it takes.
good luck #fadeaway
