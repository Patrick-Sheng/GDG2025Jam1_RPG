...Hello. A new arrival. I could tell by the way you walk, unsure. Still searching.
I’ve been in this tank for a long time. Longer than most can remember.
My water… it’s disappearing. Bit by bit.
They say it’s ‘natural,’ but you’re smarter than that, aren’t you?

(Pisiel pauses, eyes glowing faintly)

It’s punishment. I... said something I shouldn't have.
About Him.
I knew something I wasn’t supposed to know. And now the water goes.

Still, you’re free to try. If you want to help me, I won’t stop you.
