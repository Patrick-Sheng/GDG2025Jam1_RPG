...That feels like warmth.  
I had forgotten what it’s like to be cared for without a reason.  
Let me give you something in return—a truth, or perhaps... a warning.  
The ‘God’ of this place has never judged anyone. Not a single soul.  
I cannot tell you more. You’ll have to find out what comes next.  
Go to the pond. I will help you find the 'helper'. #changePond  
...As someone kind, I hope you can save this world.  
Goodbye.
